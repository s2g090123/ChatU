## About
ChatU is a chat application which utilizes multiple services provided by Firebase. 

ChatU uses Firebase Authentication for registration and login, establishes a friends list after registration and login, and uses Firebase Realtime Database to store and synchronize chat records. In addition, Firebase Cloud Messaging ensures that users receive real-time notifications of new messages during chat sessions.

## Technology
